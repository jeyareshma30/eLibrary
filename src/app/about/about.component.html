<h3>E-Library:</h3>
<p>An e-library or Digital library is a physical site and/ or website that provide around the clock online access to digitized audio, video, and written material. It provides free copies of books, journals, etc. available to the users. Normally these materials are classics which have no copyright digital formats (as opposed to print, microform, or other media) and accessible by computers. The digital content may be stored locally, or accessed remotely via computer networks. A digital library is a type of information retrieval system. Digital Libraries are an increasingly popular research area that encompasses more than traditional information retrieval or database methods and techniques. There are many numbers of definitions.

    An e-library is electronic information, library organizers usage of the catalog, tag and search books, and journals. It maintains a database as the collection of e-materials and provides services in digital form. Many libraries traditionally have been repositories of local information and heritage documents such as manuscripts, rare books, maps, photographs, and paintings, etc. In university libraries, documents generated in —house such as dissertation and theses, research reports, etc. represent the intellectual strength of the institution. Libraries are developing digital repositories of such resourced and providing access to the internet or intranet access to these. Large public and academic libraries also provide up to date local information via the internet. Digital libraries are a natural progression from electronic document sharing. The main benefit of a digital library is the ability to provide around the clock, remote access to high-demand or restricted materials for multiple concurrent users. Setting up a digital library can either be done by using ‘off-the-shelf digital library products, document management products or library management products capable of digital library management or in-house system development by using open archives software. A simple definition of the digital library is ‘a library consisting of digital materials and services. Digital materials are items that are stored, processed and transferred via digital (binary) devices and networks. Digital library services are information services that are delivered digitally over computer networks.</p>
    
    <h3>Advantages of E-Library:</h3>
    
    <p>E-library is the easiest to use the available online research tool.
    Standards searching help the educators to integrate the technology into the curriculum, by increasing the technology literacy.
    Students can use the search by topic feature to retrieve a manageable amount of quality content, quickly and easily.
    Public libraries need to offer an easy-to-use research solution to patrons.
    Point-and-click functionality ensures all the users finding the information they need.
    The reference desk gives integrated access to a dictionary, encyclopedia, almanacs, and much more.
    Visually impaired people are no longer disabled in searching and surfing information on the digital library.</p>
     
    
   <p>There are a number of reasons for building digital libraries such as. information explosion, dwindling budgets of the library, space problem, high information demand, available technologies, etc. The other major points, which compel us for the digitisation of present-day libraries, are,
    
    Documents and other materials hashed in the collection of traditional libraries are deteriorating at a rapid rate.
    Libraries with a unique collection of manuscripts and archives should be digitized so that these rare materials should be available for extensive access throughout.
    Digital Library Technology is to manage a lot of digital content such as thousands of images, audio clips, etc.
    The vast amount of information being created and stored each day makes it more difficult to find specific information later. There are electronic tools, which enable this to be done quickly and easily by text search and also by the actual searching on the closer texture and even in shapes in images.
    Digital libraries enable greater access to the content. They are capable of managing the content from multiple locations and provide a way to enrich the teaching and learning environment from the distance.
    The information available on the web is not uniformly distributed and only a small portion of which exists in print.</p>
    <h3>Impact of e-resources in modern Library and Information Centers:</h3>
    <p>Information technology is suggested in the context of Fourth Law of Library Science  “save the time of the Reader / Staff” in which S. R. Ranganathan recognized an objective relating to the internal efficiency of the library.
    
    The rapid growth of information and communication technologies have given rise to the evolution of several new jargons like paperless society, electronic resources, portal 7 gateway, and global digital library. In the day context, all types of libraries viz: academic, public and special are not only providing printed resources to their library users rather they provide printed, electronic as well as other Internet resources like e-books and databases for fulfilling the day to day academic and research requirements of the library users.e-resources-impact-in-library
    
    The challenge, the present society faces in the 21st century is keeping pace with the rapid developments in the information and communication technology, one needs to continuously upgrade their knowledge and skills. It is understood that we live in an information-rich society where the amount of information and knowledge in the present world is increasing at a tremendous pace. Information literacy is the ability to evaluate information across the range information needed, locate, synthesize and use the information effectively, using technology, communication networks, and electronic resources. Information literacy includes the full range of experience, and the user needs to enable the use of information literacy.
    
    People who are not fond of reading will agree with the fact that a library is the most peaceful place on the earth. The library is like a corpora of knowledge. One could find books in a library in almost all topics, like history, geography, or even science e-fiction. Libraries are considered as the shrine where all the relics of the ancient saints, full of true virtue, and that without delusion or imposture, are preserved. A library is like the thole world encompassed in one room. Without a library, an institution will not be complete. It is very essential to the education and any problem, any query unanswered one can find it in one of the books stored in the library. Libraries are an integral part of the education system and one is incomplete without the other. A well-stocked library is an asset to any institution.
    
    A library is a place where not only books but also magazines, journals, and newspapers are well-stocked for the benefit of the readers. Besides this one can also get the entire charts, Encyclopedia, government gazette, etc. A reader can either read in the library or borrow the book/journal of his choice and take it home. A library is a popular place in the academic curriculum. With the growing popularity of the internet, the retrieval of information becomes faster. In view of the above facts, it is apparent that a library is a very important place in society.
    
    Libraries are the repositories of knowledge form of an integral part of education. The primary objective of the library is to organize and provide access to information. This objective will never change but the format and methods that are used will change dramatically, providing new opportunities and challenges. Libraries have witnessed a great metamorphosis in recent years. The print medium is increasingly giving way to the electronic form of materials. The library is an extremely important entity in an ever-changing society and it must be responsive to the needs of society. Information Technology (IT) has changed the complexion of today’s libraries. Libraries have evolved to become an information provider rather than mere document providers. The shift from the traditional libraries to the digital is not merely a technological evolution but requires a change in the paradigm by which the users access and interact with information. This move from traditional to electronic libraries also alters the fundamental role of the library.</p>
